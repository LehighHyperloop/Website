His family builds residential homes for a living and he has a firm grasp of how to use all hand and power tools. Grant has led all aspects of pod fabrication, shipping box fabrication, and workspace training. It is one thing to design the sub-systems necessary to make the pod work as a collegiate-level engineer, but it takes a lot more to keep those designers in the land of realism, and produce a final working product. Without him, there is no way the pod could have been built or shipped across the country. Grant taught the entire build team how to use the tools necessary to build the pod and acted as the foreman for the build process. Grant has been such a enormous part of the team that it was an easy decision to promote him to his current position as Co-Team Captain.

                                Alex joined the team in September, 2016. After coming into the team, he jumped straight into the electrical subsystem team, learning the Hyperloop 1 system, and helping finish its installation. Since then, he designed the life-support system for the Hyperloop 2 system, and will work to improve and integrate the electrical subsystem, as its lead.</em></p>
